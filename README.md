That is the perfect next step! A high-quality README file will serve as a permanent showcase for your skills and provide context to anyone (including a headhunter) who visits the repository from your LinkedIn post.Here is a comprehensive and professionally structured README file based on our conversation.üåê Kubernetes StatefulSet Demo: Unique Identity and Persistent StorageA hands-on project demonstrating the deployment and management of a fault-tolerant, stateful web application using core Kubernetes primitives. This project showcases the fundamental principles required to manage complex distributed data platforms like Kafka, OpenSearch, or databases on Kubernetes.üöÄ OverviewThis repository contains the necessary YAML manifests to deploy a 3-replica Nginx cluster managed by a StatefulSet.The core objective is to ensure each application instance (Pod) has a stable, unique identity and dedicated persistent storage that survives pod deletion and rescheduling. This is achieved by:Using a Headless Service for stable network identity.Employing volumeClaimTemplates for dedicated Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).Utilizing an initContainer to inject a unique state (the Pod's hostname) onto its volume upon startup, proving persistence.üí° The Learning Takeaway: Code is KeyThis project strongly reinforces the principle that fundamental understanding comes from writing and debugging the code itself. The initial process involved crucial troubleshooting of indentation errors (volumeClaimTemplates placement) and typos, which provided a deeper comprehension of the Kubernetes API schema than simple copy-pasting ever could. This hands-on, troubleshooting approach is vital for real-world DevOps maturity.üõ†Ô∏è PrerequisitesA local Kubernetes cluster (Docker Desktop Kubernetes, Minikube, or K3s).kubectl configured to connect to your cluster.The Git CLI installed and configured (especially with the Git Credential Manager for token caching on WSL).(Recommended) WSL 2 (Ubuntu/Debian) environment for seamless testing and troubleshooting.‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Guide (GitOps Workflow)Follow these steps to deploy and test the application on your cluster.1. Clone the RepositoryClone this repository to your local machine:Bashgit clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
cd k8s-statefulset-demo
2. Apply the ManifestsThe kubectl apply command will create both the Headless Service (nginx) and the StatefulSet (web).Bashkubectl apply -f .
3. Verification & Status CheckThe StatefulSet will create three resources sequentially (web-0, web-1, web-2), binding a unique PVC to each one. Wait for all resources to become ready:Bash# Watch the status of the deployment (StatefulSet, Pods, and PVCs)
kubectl get statefulset,pod,pvc -w
Wait until the web StatefulSet is 3/3 ready, and all PVCs are Bound.Resource TypeExpected CountKey StatusPods3RunningStatefulSet13/3 ReadyPVCs3Bound4. Test Persistence and IdentityUse kubectl port-forward to establish a direct connection from your host machine (Windows/WSL) to a specific Pod. This proves that the initContainer successfully wrote a unique, persistent file to that Pod's dedicated volume.Bash# Forward local port 8080 to Pod 'web-1' port 80
kubectl port-forward web-1 8080:80
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.Expected output: <h1>My hostname is web-1</h1>üóëÔ∏è CleanupTo tear down the environment and reclaim resources:Stop the port-forward command (Ctrl+C).Delete the Service and StatefulSet:Bashkubectl delete -f .
Manually delete the PVCs (required because StatefulSets do not delete PVCs by default, protecting your data):Bashkubectl delete pvc www-web-0 www-web-1 www-web-2
